# jethe

Jethe is a typescript library for building a node/typescript-based website with ajax (and later maybe websocket) support.

It provides the file server and routing to build an api, and the static content would presumably be written in another repository.

Just wrote this yesterday, so there's still a ways to go. Please feel free to put feature requests in Issues.

Thanks.
